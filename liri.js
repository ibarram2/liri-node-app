//I know I need to make npm requests now to retrieve the information that is required of the commands outlined in the HW.
//it's 4 am and I'm sorry for not having more time to follow through.
//the code I need to modfy to access these API's is below.

//var request = require('request');
//request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  //console.log('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred 
  //console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received 
  //console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage. 
//});

//i would then need to write code capable of taking arguments from the user to pull that information from the API and then console log it back to the user.
//i know there isn't much. sorry.
